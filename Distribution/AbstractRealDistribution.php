         * --------------------
         * Where applicable, use is made of the one-sided Chebyshev inequality
         * to bracket the root. This inequality states that
         * P(X - mu >= k * sig) <= 1 / (1 + k^2),
         * mu: mean, sig: standard deviation. Equivalently
         * 1 - P(X < mu + k * sig) <= 1 / (1 + k^2),
         * F(mu + k * sig) >= k^2 / (1 + k^2).
         *
         * For k = sqrt(p / (1 - p)), we find
         * F(mu + k * sig) >= p,
         * and (mu + k * sig) is an upper-bound for the root.
         *
         * Then, introducing Y = -X, mean(Y) = -mu, sd(Y) = sig, and
         * P(Y >= -mu + k * sig) <= 1 / (1 + k^2),
         * P(-X >= -mu + k * sig) <= 1 / (1 + k^2),
         * P(X <= mu - k * sig) <= 1 / (1 + k^2),
         * F(mu - k * sig) <= 1 / (1 + k^2).
         *
         * For k = sqrt((1 - p) / p), we find
         * F(mu - k * sig) <= p,
         * and (mu - k * sig) is a lower-bound for the root.
         *
         * In cases where the Chebyshev inequality does not apply, geometric
         * progressions 1, 2, 4, ... and -1, -2, -4, ... are used to bracket
         * the root.
